# HealthyHaBits
Healthy HaBits is a unique scheduling application that autonomously schedules proper sleeping, eating, and exercise times based on age, weight, and work schedule. The algorithm adjusts accordingly based on user input and preferences to give the user an optimal schedule to follow that will improve their overall habits. This application also returns user statistics, so the individual can see their progress overtime, percentage of sleep, nutrients, and exercise achieved, and how they can best adjust their schedule to improve these statistics.
